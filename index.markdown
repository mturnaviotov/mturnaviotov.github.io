Hi. My name is Mykola.

I am an IT expert, DevOps/Architect
with system administration and programming skills, I have been working as a DevOps engineer for the last 8+ years.

I also have a mentoring program for junior DevOps specialists, where we start from scratch and write our own small test application, up to creating an entire local mini-infrastructure Kubernetes to deploy this application, mastering all the necessary basic DevOps principles and methods.
